    <h3> About me</h3>
  
    <p> My name is Joel Alumasa and I reside in Nairobi, Kenya. I'm an <strong>A-levels graduate</strong> and an aspring contributor to the advancement
      of the fourth industrial revolution. I completed year 13 in June 2019 and have since been on a gap-year,
      before I join <strong>ALU</strong> <em>(African Leadership University)</em> in September for a BSC in computer science. As a recent highschool graduate,
      it should be fairly obvious that I have no job experience. 
    </p>
    <p> When I completed my  IGCSE o-levels (year 11) back in 2017, I decided 
      to join an institute called IIHT in order to learn computer skills. To put it simply, I was thoroughly disappointed
      and came out with mostly theoretical knowledge - all of which I have no memory of right now.
      I decided to apply to moringa during my gap-year, to gauge whether it is an institution worth investing my time into.
      As stated above, I am motivated to learn programming in order to take part in the information era that dawned upon the earth during the 90's.
      The initial industrial revolution was the greatest event in mankind's history - it enabled the gross domestic output of the world to expand beyond
      just agricultural produce. The renaissance, the medieval era and the other era's that precede them are simply not worth comparison.
      Now that a new technological revolution is on the horizon, who wouldn't want to ride such a wave?
    </p>
    <p>My plan is simple: use moringa school as a platform to develop tech-savy skills and gain knowledge. 
      With those skills, I would proceed to further hone them at ALU, so that I leave university as a graduate who is ready to grab this revolution by the horns.
    </p>
    <p> My hobbies include: playing and watching football, playing video games and watching anime. 
      For all its worth, I'm a Chelsea fan, play Fifa, and have watched One piece, Naruto and many other anime series within different genres (likely over 400 hours of anime).
      I'm also interested in online money-making methods - <em>such as Amazon's FBA</em> - and hope to further investigate it in university.
    </p>
